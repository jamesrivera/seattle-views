##Neighborhood Map Project (West & Central Seattle)
Created by James Rivera

Project hosted at: http://jamesrivera.github.io/seattle-views/

###Description
Implemented Google Maps and Knockout APIs to create a searchable, geo-marked 
map of the Seattle area.

###UI Functionality
* The navigation menu on left side of screen can be used to select from location list.
* The search box at the top of the navigation menu can take input to filter list items.
* Clicking either a list item or a map marker will bring up location information.
* The page uses the Flickr API by pulling photos directly from their back-end server.
* Markers are zoomed in on and centered when clicked. List items also become active.
* The about button links directly to the project's README file for instructions.
* The reset button can be used to easily reset the page.
* The site is responsive.
